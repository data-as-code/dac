**IMPORTANT**: Currently the project is in the initial development phase, this is why releases are marked as `0.z.y`.
(following [semantic versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/): "Major version zero (0.y.z) is for initial development.
Anything MAY change at any time. The public API SHOULD NOT be considered stable.").
While in this phase, we will denote breaking changes with a minor increase.
